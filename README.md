# RandomWordByLength

Welcome to random_word_by_length! This CLI GEM will generate random words by length and therefore (often) difficulty. You can select easy, medium or hard and you will be delivered a random word scraped from https://www.merriam-webster.com/. You will then be prompted with the option to get further details including kind of word, definition and a pointer to synonyms.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'random_word_by_length'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install random_word_by_length

## Usage

Navigate to the repository and run the command ruby bin/random-word-by-length, then follow the prompts!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
